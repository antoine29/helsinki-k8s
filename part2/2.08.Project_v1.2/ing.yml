# Ingress is working as a LB in port host:8081 -> cluster:80 (since we mapped that port on k3d cluster creation (6.web-server.../readme.md:19))
# so we are redirecting trafic on '/' path to cluster port 2345 (previously mapped in web-server-service)

# all the req resorce (after port ie localhost:8080/...) is being passed to the service
